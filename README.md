# To Do App

##### The entire project took me about 4 hours. The login took about 2 hours. One hour to do everything and then I spent a whole hour trying to figure out a cors error which I still did not figure out. I have run into a similar issue before but I was making the requests on a backend so it was easy to resolve. Here I could not figure it out, the conclusion I have come up with is that the request needs to be made from a server. If there is another way, please tell because I tried a lot of things and went on a dive in to cors and chromium to try and get past the issue but couldn't, it will be helpful for the future. Then I spent about 2 hours on the list page; the logic took a while there but everything seems to be working and the design looks nice.
